<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>The temporal development of software has been studied for many
decades, commonly through the development of individual pieces of
software or, in rarer cases, comparative studies between a select few
pieces of software <span class="citation">(see comprehensive literature
reviews in Syeed, Hammouda, and Syatä 2013; Chahal and Saini
2016)</span>. Software is dependent upon and shaped by developments in
other packages or libraries. Any computer language has associated with
it an evolving ecosystem of software packages and their
interdependencies. The evolution of any one component of that ecosystem
is best studied in the context of the evolution of the ecosystem as a
whole.</p>
<p>One focal point of historically individual studies on software
evolution has been the work of <span class="citation">Lehman et al.
(1997)</span>, who expressed their findings as a series of “laws” of
software evolution. These “laws” include that, over time, software
increases both in complexity and in functional content (or numbers of
“modules”). Those laws of growth themselves derive from <span class="citation">Turski (1996)</span>, who posited an empirically
observed inverse-square law for software growth, later formalised in
<span class="citation">Turski (2002)</span>.</p>
<p>These “laws” of software evolution have strongly influenced the
development of “Software Mining and Analytics” <span class="citation">(Mens 2008)</span>. The field is focused on elucidating
predictors of software quality. A useful overview was provided by <span class="citation">Allamanis and Sutton (2013)</span>, who identified a
number of research categories within this broad field, including one of
“code statistics.”</p>
<p>For many computer languages, individual pieces of open-source
software (“packages”) are held and distributed through centralized
package distribution services <span class="citation">(Ovens 2018)</span>
(“repositories”). These curated repositories of
independently-contributed software exist for computer languages
including python <span class="citation">(Harihareswara 2018)</span>,
LaTeX <span class="citation">(<span>“CTAN”</span> 2021)</span>,
JavaScript <span class="citation">(Goldwater 2020)</span>, and many
others <span class="citation">(as well as operating-system specific
repositories as described in Debian Policy Editors 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Package repositories have collective properties that emerge from
individual packages and their interdependencies <span class="citation">(Decan, Mens, and Claes 2016)</span>. <span class="citation">Decan, Mens, and Grosjean (2019)</span> examined the
evolution of dependency networks from seven package distribution
systems, including the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). They
observed that the Gini coefficient of inequality between dependent
packages has increased over time in all systems. On CRAN, they found
that both numbers of packages and numbers of dependencies have increased
more slowly than for any of the other systems, as have numbers of
package updates. They also observed that the “survival probability”
(that a package is updated after some given time) has been far greater
for CRAN than for other package ecosystems. This rate differed between
packages with and without reverse dependencies.</p>
<p>There have also been detailed considerations of dependency networks
from individual package distribution systems. <span class="citation">Gonzalez-Barahona et al. (2009)</span> showed
progressive increases in Debian package inter-dependencies. They
observed increases in the sizes of packages over time, and claimed that
these reflected the laws of <span class="citation">Lehman et al.
(1997)</span>. They also observed that the relative sizes of packages,
measured in terms of lines of code, remained relatively stable across
releases. A recent analysis of the “pypi” (Python Package Index) package
distribution system for python <span class="citation">(Bommarito and
Bommarito 2019)</span> represented the most comprehensive analysis to
that time of a single package distribution system for any computer
language, drawn from almost two million releases of 179,000
packages.</p>
<p>The size of pypi necessarily restricted analyses to package metadata,
although single metrics of package size were also included. Moreover,
the size of pypi meant that analyses of dependency networks were also
restricted to aggregate statistics only, with no analyses of the
internal properties of dependency networks themselves. Thus while this
represents an exemplary study of the evolution of a package distribution
system, the size of this system precluded any analyses of how individual
pieces of software evolve both internally, and in relation to the
aggregate evolution of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Compared with pypi, CRAN, the dominant repository of R packages, is
more modest in size and more tractable for analysis in trends in
development at both the individual and network level. Currently at
~140,000 releases of approximately 24,000 packages, it is about tenth
the size of pypi. Studies of CRAN have to date largely considered
package metadata such as DESCRIPTION files or personal networks of
package authors. <span class="citation">Plakidas, Schall, and Zdun
(2017)</span> examined metadata from DESCRIPTION files, and found that
the average R package has become more dependent on other packages over
time, yet less likely to be depended on by other packages. They also
revealed a high likelihood of authors of CRAN (and BioConductor)
packages contributing code to other packages, although more recent
developments have increased the dominance of single authors who do not
contribute to other packages.</p>
<p>Other authors have examined relationships between CRAN and software
development platforms such as GitHub <span class="citation">(Decan et
al. 2015, 2016)</span>, revealing GitHub to represent an “incubator” for
early-stage code, and progression to CRAN happening once packages reach
sufficient maturity. As a result, CRAN is relatively internally-stable,
whereas GitHub packages depend on CRAN packages, yet not the other way
around.</p>
<p>Analyses which have considered individual packages have also mostly
examined aggregate data such as sizes of packages or dependency networks
between packages. <span class="citation">German, Adams, and Hassan
(2013)</span> compared aggregate statistics of base, recommended, and
contributed packages, and found contributed packages to grow in size at
a faster rate that base or recommended packages, but for recommended
packages to have far greater numbers of releases. <span class="citation">Mora-Cantallops, Sánchez-Alonso, and García-Barriocanal
(2020)</span> examined metadata from DESCRIPTION files, and found the
dependency network between packages to be generally
“<em>scale-free</em>”, or dominated by a relatively small number of
highly-connected packages. They also observed individual packages
becoming increasingly dependent on other packages, yet less likely to be
depended on.</p>
<p>The present work builds on this prior work, through drawing on
analyses of the entire contents of R packages, naturally including the
DESCRIPTION files, but all the contents of all code, documentation, and
testing directories. We begin by describing the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats" class="external-link">the <code>{pkgstats}</code> R
package</a>, which can be used to generate and analyse properties of R
package code, and the accompanying publicly-available database of code
statistics of all historical CRAN packages. We then describe trends in
CRAN package properties over the history of the archive, focussing on
trends in four areas: Package metadata (licenses, authorship,
translation), internal content and structure (file and function types
and sizes), intra-package code structure (function call networks), and
finally, dependency networks amongst packages. Finally, we discuss
implications and likely drivers of these trends, and potential further
applications and extensions of <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats" class="external-link">the <code>{pkgstats}</code>
package</a> and database.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#methods"></a>
</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, in an article commemorating his “early history of the
R project” ten years prior to that, Kurt Hornik called for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a considerable and concerted community effort … providing R packages
to compute on R packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We developed the {pkgstats} package to quantify the structure and
content of R packages using static code analysis <span class="citation">(Papamichail, Diamantopoulos, and Symeonidis
2016)</span>. The package includes a function,
<code>pkgstats_from_archive()</code>, which can be applied to a local
mirror of the CRAN archive to collate statistics from all packages.
{pkgstats} generates 95 variables quantifying and qualifying package
code. As the full process is computationally intensive, we have
published the data on all packages (current and previous versions) on
CRAN as of <date>, and expect to update this resource regularly. These
data are available as the “pkgstats-CRAN-all” data set at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7414296" class="external-link">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7414296</a>.</date></p>
<p>We studied R packages hosted on the CRAN including historical package
versions and archived (deprecated) packages. This includes the R
language itself, defined by a single “package” referred to as “base R”.
We include and distinguish between this “base” package, the suite of
default <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/tree/trunk/src/library" class="external-link">“recommended”
packages</a>, and the overwhelming majority of “contributed” packages
<span class="citation">(German, Adams, and Hassan 2013)</span>. Our
analysis ran on a local mirror of CRAN as of December 2022, comprising
21,089 contributed packages, and 112,212 total package versions (for an
average of slightly under 5 releases per package).</p>
<p>In this paper we describe trends in the variables described in the
four following subsections. {pkgstats} generates these as well as a
larger superset of package-level statistics, the full list of which is
in the online documentation.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="package-metadata">Package metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-metadata"></a>
</h3>
<p>Package-level metadata largely come from the Debian Control File
(“DCF”) named “DESCRIPTION” <span class="citation">(Hornik 2012)</span>,
in all packages, which contains a subset of standard DCF fields. We
extracted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers of authors (as individuals with a specified role of
“aut”);</li>
<li>Numbers of contributors (as individuals with a specified role of
“ctb”);</li>
<li>Full entries of the “License” field specifying the type of license
under which the software was released; and</li>
<li>Entries in the “URL” field specifying one or more Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs) for the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also extracted a list of (human) languages provided in each R
package for localization. R packages may include files used to translate
all messages issued by code into other (human) languages. These files
are placed in a dedicated /po sub-directory, with file names prefixed
with standard prefixes (generally, but not necessarily, ISO 639-1
codes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="lines-of-code-loc">Lines of Code (LoC)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lines-of-code-loc"></a>
</h3>
<p>We quantified different types of source code from from R packages,
using a custom C++ tool included in {pkgstats} This tool produces output
similar to many common “Lines of Code” (LoC) analysis tools tools, plus
addition information on white space and structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines of code per (computer) language used in the package</li>
<li>Lines of code, comment, and blank lines;</li>
<li>Characters in code lines, along with numbers of white-space
characters, to enable metrics of proportional white space; and</li>
<li>Code indentation, including identification of tab-indentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These white-space and indentation metrics were developed to enable
quantification of aspects of code outlay and design.</p>
<p>We measure these metrics across the following subsets of code. First,
by function type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exported functions intended to be called by users of a package;
and</li>
<li>Non-exported functions intended only to be called internally by
other functions of a package.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also by the sub-directories of R packages, which accord to the
structure the structure defined in the “Writing R Extensions” Manual
:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>/R</code> directory which holds all source files in the R
language;</li>
<li>The <code>/src</code> directory which holds all code in other
languages which needs to be compiled on package installation;</li>
<li>The <code>/inst</code> directory which generally holds bundles of
external code, but may also include code used for cross-linking in
compilation, including of other packages. Cross-linked code must be in
an <code>/inst/include</code> sub-directory (as explained in this
section of the “Writing R Extensions” Manual). All of the following
analyses only consider the <code>/inst/include</code> directory, and all
references to the <code>/inst</code> directory imply this sub-directory
only. Analyses excluded all other sub-directories within the
<code>/inst</code> directory.</li>
<li>The <code>/vignettes</code> directory which includes extended
documentation. (Such documentation may also be placed in an
<code>/inst/doc</code> folder, but this was ignored here.)</li>
<li>The <code>/tests</code> directory containing test files.</li>
<li>The <code>/data</code> directory containing data files used to
implement or demonstrate package functionality.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="static-code-analysis">Static code analysis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#static-code-analysis"></a>
</h3>
<p>We conducted static code analysis, identifying functions and objects
in both R and compiled code in packages to characterize them at the
function, package, and network level.</p>
<p>Static code analysis tools generally work by constructing parse trees
which relate a grammar describing one or more computer languages to each
expression encountered by tracing the code. An important first step is
to “tag” each expression, identifying the kind of expression and its
scope, implying its membership either of some component of the
underlying grammar.</p>
<p>{pkgstats} incorporates two open-source libraries for code tagging
and parse tree construction: “Universal ctags” <span class="citation">(a
fork of the unmaintained “ctags” library, Yamato 2022)</span>, and
“gtags”, itself part of the GNU Global library <span class="citation">(Tama Communications Corporation 2013)</span>. Using
these jointly enabled us to parse both R and other languages used in
packages, and construct a “call network” of functions between languages:
“ctags” parses R code and “gtags” does not, but “gtags” parses more
languages. We linked the results of two to provide complete
coverage.</p>
<p>We used {pkgstats} to tag each expression in the R, src, and
inst/include directories, providing the following data for each tagged
item:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tag itself, such as the name of a function, variable, or other
object;</li>
<li>The name and path of the corresponding file;</li>
<li>The full content of the expression in which that tag was used (as a
text string);</li>
<li>The kind of object (in R files, generally a function, functionVar or
variable defined within a function, globalVar for global variables, or
other objects defined by the R language; kinds of objects can be
arbitrarily diverse in other languages);</li>
<li>The computer language in which that object was referenced; and</li>
<li>The start and end line numbers of the file in which that object is
defined or referenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the package, level we aggregated these values to produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers of internal and external functions in R.</li>
<li>Numbers and kinds of objects in other languages.</li>
<li>Lines-of-Code for each function or object definition in each
language.</li>
<li>References from each function (or object) made to all other
functions (or objects), including references made to all functions
defined in other base, recommended, or contributed R packages (see
network analyses, below) .</li>
</ul>
<p>We also parsed the R documentation (.Rd) files in each package using
the <code>parse_Rd</code> and <code>Rd2txt</code> functions of the
“recommended” {tools} package. From these we extracted the function in
an R package must have a corresponding documentation file in the number
of parameters for each function, and the number of documentation
characters for each parameter and the total length of documentation for
each function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="network-analyses">Network Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#network-analyses"></a>
</h3>
<p>We analyzed two networks within our extracted data: inter-package
analyses of dependency networks between packages <span class="citation">(akin to Decan, Mens, and Grosjean 2019)</span>, and
intra-package analyses of the function call networks extracted from the
“ctags” and “gtags” data described above.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="inter-package-network-analyses">Inter-Package Network Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#inter-package-network-analyses"></a>
</h4>
<p>The ‘DESCRIPTION’ files of R packages must specify all external
packages which a package imports. These data can be used to construct a
dependency network between all packages, with packages (vertices)
connected by their imports (edges). We derived the following value from
the package network from package dependency networks, all of which were
calculated with the {igraph} package <span class="citation">(Csardi and
Nepusz 2006)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers of packages which are not imported by any others (terminal
vertices) in a dependency network;</li>
<li>Average “in-degree” of network vertices, or average numbers of times
each package is imported by others;</li>
<li>Average <em>betweenness centrality</em> of each edge, which is the
number of times that edge is traversed in connecting every package to
every other package in the network;</li>
<li>Network-level degree centrality, which is a measure of vertex degree
standardised to the overall size and structure of the network <span class="citation">(Freeman 1978)</span>.</li>
<li>A measure of the overall “size” of the network as the average
distance between all pairs of vertices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Betweenness centrality provides insight into how centralised the
network is, with higher values reflecting networks in which connections
frequently traverse a common, central region. The network-level degree
centrality reflects the extent to which vertices all have a relatively
high in-degree; networks in which all networks have an equal in-degree
have no effective centre, and so have a degree centrality of zero. In
contrast, networks with a few highly-connected central vertices and many
vertices with low in-degree will have a high degree centrality. These
two centrality metrics provide slightly different insights: betweenness
centrality will increase to the extent to which a network manifests a
single, common centre; degree centrality will increase to the extent
that networks become more centralised in general, regardless of whether
or not any singly identifiable centre forms.</p>
<p>Networks with low degree centrality are readily traversable, and so
will generally have lower average distances between all pairs of
vertices. The distance metric offer additional insight. It will, for
example, be higher independent of degree centrality for networks with
extended peripheral connections. Finally, we note that clusters or local
network communities were not considered here, as the dependency networks
of CRAN packages are almost always so highly connected that the largest
connected cluster represents over 99% of the network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="intra-package-network-analyses">Intra-Package Network Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intra-package-network-analyses"></a>
</h3>
<p>We used the references generated by the static code tagging to
construct an “function call network”, of all references in R function to
other functions within the packages and to their dependencies, including
base and recommended packages, and contributed packages imported.
Functions were attributed to packages by matching function names.
Function names in R do not have to be unique, and “namespace conflicts”
may arise between packages implementing different functions with the
same name. We presumed that namespace conflicts most commonly arise in
re-definitions of functions initially defined in base or recommended
packages, and in all such cases we attributed a function to the external
or contributed package over definitions in the base or recommended
packages. Intra-package networks also included code in other languages
included in <code>/src</code> directories.</p>
<p>Function call networks within individual packages are commonly
structured in several distinct clusters, and thus numbers of clusters
provided an important first metric for intra-package analyses.
Intra-package analyses considered the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ratio of numbers of edges to numbers of vertices.</li>
<li>Numbers of distinct clusters between all functions or objects across
all languages.</li>
<li>The betweenness centrality of the function call network.</li>
<li>Numbers of terminal vertices (functions which do not call any other
functions).</li>
<li>The average vertex degree.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="coupling-instability">Coupling Instability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coupling-instability"></a>
</h4>
<p>Coupling Instability is an important concept in the analysis of
software dependency networks <span class="citation">(Martin
2003)</span>, and depends in turn on numbers of so-called afferent and
efferent couplings. For any given package, these are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Afferent Couplings: numbers of functions in other packages which
depend on functions within the package.</li>
<li>Efferent Couplings: numbers of functions from other packages which
the package depends on.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, afferent couplings are numbers of inbound edges from
all other packages to a given package, while efferent couplings are
outbound edges coupling that package with all other packages.</p>
<p>Respectively denoting afferent and efferent couplings by <span class="math inline">\(n_a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_e\)</span>, the coupling instability, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, is defined as <span class="math inline">\(I = n_e / (n_e + n_a)\)</span>. Packages which
depend on many external calls (high efferent couplings), yet upon which
few other packages depend (low afferent couplings) thus have a high
coupling instability, while packages upon which many other packages
depend, yet which themselves depend on few other packages have a low
coupling instability. The analyses below quantified coupling instability
for each package from the dependency networks, using total numbers of
function calls between all packages, in order to estimate the average
coupling instability of the entire network.</p>
<p>We also adapted this measure of coupling instability between packages
to a measure of internal coupling instability <span class="citation">(Almugrin and Melton 2015)</span> between the
individual files of one package. Packages with high internal coupling
instability make many calls between individual files, while packages
with low internal instability make more calls within single files, and
relatively fewer between them.</p>

<p>We report descriptive statistics of change in the above measures of
CRAN software over time, focusing on two types of change: developments
across all packages on CRAN simultaneously, and developments for
individual packages over sequences of releases.</p>
<p>We summarize all-CRAN developments using two measures: annual values
and snapshots. Annual values are comprised of values of packages
uploaded or updated in a specific year, disregarding packages uploaded
in previous years and not yet updated. Snapshots represent values of all
packages on CRAN at the end of a given year, regardless of how long ago
a package may previously have been updated. In general, trends in
snapshots are smoother than annual values. In figures below, solid lines
represent annual values and dashed lines represent snapshots unless
otherwise indicated. As most values calculated were log-distributed, we
report trends in geometric mean values (<span class="math inline">\(\exp\left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ln
a_i\right]\)</span>).</p>
<p>Under the plausible assumption that rates of package updates follow
some kind of Poisson-like process, the ages of packages at any given
time will be exponentially distributed, analogous to distributions of
waiting times for Poisson processes. This means that values derived
using <strong>CRAN snapshots</strong> will generally reflect
exponentially-smoothed versions of <strong>annual</strong> values. Many
of the graphical results which follow depict results derived using both
of these approaches, in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>solid lines represent annual values, which are generally noisier
versions of</li>
<li>dashed lines, which represent effectively exponentially-smoothed
versions of the same data using CRAN snapshots for each year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where no additional interpretations are given, solid lines in all of
the results that follow represent annual values, while dashed lines
represent results derived from CRAN shapshots. See Fig. 1A immediately
below, for an example. Where also not otherwise mentioned, all reported
values refer to (generally noisier) annual values, and not to values
derived from (generally smoother) CRAN snapshots.</p>

<p>Numbers of both authors and contributors have increased over time
(Fig. 1A), with contributors having been rarely acknowledged at all
prior to 2010. Acknowledgement of contributions increased soon after
then to an average of just under one acknowledged contributor per
package in 2022. Encouragingly, recent increases in numbers of both
authors and contributors have been broadly linear, and show no sign of
slowing down.</p>
<p>Diversity of license declarations increased up to around 2007,
followed by a pronounced drop and progression into a roughly stable
range of somewhere over 50 distinct entries. Numbers of unique licenses
primarily reflect numbers of ways of declaring licenses, rather than
numbers of actual licenses (for example, “GPL &gt;= 2.0” is different to
“Any GPL license version 2 or higher”, although both clearly refer to
the same license). The different ways of specifying the three versions
of GPL licenses have accounted for over 83% of all CRAN packages, with
the second most common type license being MIT, at 9.6%, followed by BSD
at 2.0%. One of these three classes of licenses are used in 95% of all
CRAN packages.</p>

<p>The practice of translating messages within R packages into other
languages has steadily declined in recent years (Fig. 2A), suggesting a
pronounced increase in acceptance over the last 15 or so years of
English as a globally standard language, and a concomitant decrease in
active acknowledgement of other languages. (The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Localization-of-messages" class="external-link"><code>en@quot</code>

and encodings.) Rates of decrease since 2008 equate to 1.5% fewer
packages per year including translations, from a total of just over 20%
of all packages in 2008, to barely over 1% in 2021. Rates of decrease
have nevertheless slowed somewhat in recent years, and the use of
translations appears to be on the rise again since 2021, perhaps
reflecting the publication of the <a href="https://michaelchirico.github.io/potools/index.html" class="external-link">{potools}

<p>The temporal development of numbers of files manifest several notable
characteristics (Figure 3). Unsurprisingly, R packages have always been
dominated by files in the <code>R/</code> directory, numbers of which
increased considerably up to around 2010, after which they have broadly
stabilised at mean values of around 13-15 files per package (Fig. 3A).
The <code>/vignettes</code> directory is the only place within R
packages in which numbers of files have remained relatively constant
over the preceding 20+ years. Packages generally had very few files in
the <code>/inst</code> directory prior to 2010, after which they
increased until around 2015, before decreasing again more recently. The
two sub-directories in which numbers of files have increased most
significantly are <code>/src</code> and <code>/tests</code>, with the
latter increase particularly distinct, clearly indicating that packages
have become progressively more tested.</p>

<p>Figure 3B shows equivalent changes <em>within</em> individual

progressively increase as packages mature, with especially pronounced
increases in the <code>/R</code>, <code>/inst</code>, and

may reflect restructuring code from the <code>/src</code> to the

other packages. Numbers of test files generally increase progressively
through package maturation. The only directory in which numbers of files
do not notably increase as packages mature is
<code>/vignettes</code>.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of a number of code metrics.
Lines of Code (“LoC”) in the primary <code>/R</code> and
<code>/src</code> sub-directories increased between 2000 and 2005, after
which time LoC in these directories have slightly decreased, converging
to just a geometric mean of just under 1,000 lines in both
<code>/R</code> and <code>/src</code> directories (Fig. 4A). LoC per
function (Fig. 4B) decreased from very high values in the early CRAN
years to stabilize from 2005-2020. The slight decreases discernible
since around 2015 amount to one LoC less for exported, non-exported, and
<code>/src</code> functions every 3.4, 8.5, and 1.5 years, respectively,
a trend that has nevertheless reversed in the most recent two years.</p>
<p>Total numbers of R functions per package initially increased until
around 2007, peaking at just under 30 exported and over 60 non-exported
functions (Fig. 4C). Numbers of exported R functions decreased since
then to around 15 exported and 25 non-exported functions shortly after
2015, before having since increased again to current respective values
of around 20 and 35. Numbers of functions defined in <code>/src</code>
directories have followed broadly similar trajectories to exported /R
functions. Numbers of functions per source file in both /R and /src
directories have nevertheless generally progressively decreased since
the early 2000’s to now amount to less than four /R functions and just
over five /src functions per file (Fig. 4D), with slight increases once
again discernible since around 2017.</p>

</h4>
<p>Figure 5 shows results equivalent to Fig. 4, but for the development
of the respective metrics with each sequential release of a package,
rather than annual developments. Lines of code generally increase as
packages mature, with mean numbers of lines in the /R directory
increasing tenfold from under 400 for first releases to over 5,000 once
packages mature beyond a 50th release. Beyond the first few releases,
there are always fewer LoC in <code>/src</code> directories than in
<code>/R</code> directories. This contrasts with the annual aggregate
results of Fig. 4A, which suggest more LoC in <code>/src</code> than
<code>/R</code> directories until sometime after 2010, and roughly equal
numbers since then. This difference reflects the fact that most packages
have only one or two releases (the distribution of numbers of releases
is not shown here, but manifests a very smooth exponential decrease), so
Fig. 4A is dominated by packages in a very early state of development,
for which LoC in <code>/src</code> often exceed numbers in
<code>/R</code>. Similar to patterns for <code>/src</code> and
<code>/inst</code> directories in Fig. 3B, decreases in LoC in
<code>/src</code> directories in the later phases of package maturation
may reflect restructuring code to <code>/inst</code> directories. This
clear peak in LoC in <code>/src</code> directories may in turn suggest
this is an approximate number of releases before other developers become
aware of the functionality of package <code>/src</code> directories. The
clearest result of Fig. 4A is manifest in total LoC, which increases in
a linear manner even out to the 100th release of a package.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/_fig05.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 5</strong> Development of code metrics
per release of each package.</p>
</div>
<p>These increases in LoC nevertheless corresponded to general decreases
in LoC per function with increasing numbers of releases (Fig. 5B). In
all directories, LoC per function either slightly increased or remained
generally stable over the first 50 or so releases, beyond which
functions in all directories clearly become considerably more
streamlined, with LoC decreasing markedly out to the 100th release.
Measures of LoC per function manifest broad peaks in all directories
after around 70 or so releases, after which they all decreased, and more
so for <code>/R</code> than for <code>/src</code> functions. The
decreases in the latter portions of Fig. 5B are equivalent to removing
one LoC per function for around every 9 releases.</p>
<p>The increasing total measures of LoC of panel A combined with
decreasing LoC per function of the latter part of panel B suggests that
more functions are added as packages mature, which is precisely what
Fig. 5C reveals. Packages initially contain less than ten exported
functions on average, yet this increases over 10-fold to around 150 by
the 100th release. Numbers of <code>/src</code> and exported
<code>/R</code> functions follow broadly similar trajectories,
increasing from under 20 functions, to well over 100 by the time of the
100th release. Numbers of non-exported <code>/R</code> functions
manifest the most pronounced increase, of over 15 times from 20
functions for initial releases, to well over 300 for the 100th release.
Finally, numbers of functions per file show no clear trend for src code,
remaining broadly stable at around 5-6 functions per file (Fig. 4D). In
contrast, <code>/R</code> code files begin with 3-4 functions per file,
and increase progressively to around eight functions per file after 100
releases, in the context of Figs. 4B-C clearly mostly due to breaking
large non-exported functions down into multiple, smaller functions.</p>
<p>Numbers of functions depicted in Fig. 4C actually count any arbitrary
code objects in all languages contained in <code>/src</code>
directories, and so corresponds directly to the “modules” posited to
increase according to the inverse-square “law” of software evolution
<span class="citation">(Turski 1996, 2002; Lehman et al. 1997)</span>.
The defining qualitative feature of such inverse–square growth is an
initially highly concave form, with rates decreasing notably as packages
mature. The trajectories of Fig. 4C appear in contrast strikingly
linear, all manifesting trajectories which would be very poorly
described by such an inverse-square form.</p>

<p>Like the “standard” libraries for the python language, R has a core
set of “base” and “recommended” packages. The function call networks
extracted by pkgstats enable counting numbers of calls to each of these
groups of packages, as well as to “contributed” packages hosted on
CRAN.</p>

<p>Figure 6A shows the change over time in proportions of calls to these
three groups of packages, revealing a recent tendency (since around
2015) of fewer calls to base R functions, from over 80% of all function
calls in the early 2000s, to below 70% in the previous two years. This
decrease has been offset by greater numbers of calls to functions in
contributed packages, while calls to recommended packages have remained
generally stable at around 20%. Although calls to contributed packages
have always represented the lowest proportion of these three groups,
this recent increase nevertheless places them on almost equal proportion
(at 12%) to calls to recommended packages (at 18%).</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 6B shows the “coupling instability” of packages over time. As
explained above, this is a measure of the extent to which packages
depend on external functionality (efferent couplings) without other
packages in turn depending on them (afferent couplings). Packages on
CRAN were largely stable until around 2010, at a coupling instability of
around 0.5, meaning numbers of functions from each package which were
imported by other packages were roughly equal to numbers of external
functions each package imported. Instability has increased markedly
since that time, indicating that packages have become increasingly
dependent on external functionality, while the average package is less
likely to provide functionality used by other packages. The coupling
instability over the preceding two years of around 80% implies that
packages make on average eight calls to other packages for every two
calls made to that package.</p>
<p>As another aggregate measure of changes in package imports, <span class="citation">Decan, Mens, and Grosjean (2019)</span> analysed Gini
coefficients, which are standardised aggregate differences in numbers of
imports between packages. Systems in which all packages import equal
numbers of dependencies have a Gini coefficient of zero, while systems
with maximally heterogeneous numbers of imports have a Gini coefficient
of one. While they concluded that Gini coefficients have increased over
time for all seven of the package distribution systems they studied
(including CRAN), at least over their time period of 2012-2017, our
equivalent results are depicted in Fig. 6C, revealing a difference on
how annual values are defined and calculated. Using “annual values”
through aggregating statistics only from packages uploaded in each year
(solid lines) yields Gini coefficients which decrease over time, while
calculating annual values as “CRAN snapshots” as the entire system would
have existed for each year (dashed lines) yields Gini coefficients which
increase over time. <span class="citation">Decan, Mens, and Grosjean
(2019)</span>’s results appear to qualitative accord with our “CRAN
snapshot” values for package dependency networks.</p>
<p>Moreover, that panel depicts Gini coefficients calculated both from
numbers of imported packages, and total numbers of external function
calls are qualitatively similar, though differing in scale.</p>
<p>Finally, figure 6D depicts changes in numbers of unique function
calls from each package to the top ten contributed packages, defined as
the ten packages with the largest total number of unique function calls
from all packages throughout the history of CRAN. The top two packages
of {ggplot2} and {dplyr} account for 15.2% of all function calls from
all contributed packages over the time shown. Numbers of function calls
are shown on a logarithmic scale, with numbers of calls to each of these
packages increasing exponentially, before more recently levelling off or
even slightly decreasing.</p>

</h4>
<p>The first two panels of Figure 7 show results equivalent to Figs
6A-B, but for changes with progressive releases of each package.
Packages tend to make progressively fewer calls to base R functions as
they mature, although this decrease is relatively less pronounced than
the overall decrease over time of Fig. 6A. In contrast changes to all
packages over time, decreases in calls to base R functions as packages
mature are offset by relative increases to calls to recommended
packages. Calls to contributed packages actually decrease as packages
mature. Such changes become relatively less pronounced over successive
releases, stabilising after around 50 releases at around 75% of all
function calls to base R, and just under 25% to contributed
packages.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/_fig07.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 7</strong> Dependency networks between

recommended packages across successive releases. (B) Coupling
instability. (C) Average numbers of functions from each package imported

other packages.</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 7B shows the average trajectory of coupling instability for
individual packages across the depicted numbers of sequential releases,
which decreases as packages mature. This would be expected if packages
are increasingly likely to be imported by other packages. Average
numbers of efferent couplings (numbers of outward calls from each
package to other packages) stay largely stable as packages develop.
Increases in package stability arise as packages develop purely through
being imported as dependencies by increasing numbers of other packages.
This suggests that the best way to counteract the increasing coupling
instability of CRAN as a whole depicted in Fig. 6B would be to ensure
that packages remain progressively developed, rather than abandoned (or
archived) after only a few releases.</p>
<p>Finally, Fig. 7C shows progressions of both packages and individual
functions being imported into other packages as a function of release
sequence. The number of packages importing a package increases
progressively with numbers of releases. Packages with less than ten
releases are, on average, imported by very few other packages, while
packages with 40 or more releases are imported by ten other packages on
average. Packages import on average only 1-2 functions from any given
package, and numbers of functions imported by other packages increase
only marginally as packages mature.</p>
<p>The slight increase in numbers of functions imported by other
packages nevertheless suggests a relationship between total numbers of
functions exported by a package (Fig. 5C), and numbers imported by other
packages. Taking only the latest versions of all packages and relating
these two values reveals that other packages are likely to import one
additional function on average for every 2.8 additional functions
exported by a package.</p>

<p>The first two panels of Fig. 8 show the temporal development of the
CRAN package dependency network. Most network metrics have broadly
stabilised over the preceding five or so years, with variations much
more pronounced prior to 2015. The proportion of terminal vertices, or
packages not imported by any other packages, has remained broadly stable
at around 55-60% of all packages. The mean vertex degree of the
dependency network has nevertheless progressively increased, especially
since around 2012, indicating that those packages which are imported by
others have been imported by increasing numbers of other packages (Fig.
8A).</p>

the CRAN dependency network, and (C-D) Function call networks within

</div>
<p>Such an increase in average numbers of imports increases the overall
connectivity of the dependency network. Fig. 8B showing concomitant
decreases in both centrality metrics over time. Average distances
between each pair of packages in the network increased notably up to
around 2013, after which time they have decreased. Since numbers of
terminal vertices have remained generally stable, while centrality has
decreased, the initial increase in mean distance likely reflects
terminal vertices becoming further away. This may reflect the network
evolving a number of distinct centres. The more recent decrease in mean
distance may then reflect an equivalent centralisation of the dependency
network.</p>
<p>The lower two panels of Fig. 8 depict the evolution of function call
networks within individual packages. Fig. 8C shows the ratio of numbers
of edges to numbers of vertices, with higher values indicating more
densely connected networks. Since around 2005, network connections
within R functions, whether exported or not, have remained largely
constant, with each function being called by around 5-6 other functions.
Connections between functions in <code>/src</code> directories have in
contrast decreased considerably, with each <code>/src</code> function
(or object) now being “called” (or referenced, inherited, or any other
method) by just over one other function. The “total” line in Fig. 8C
reveals that ratios of edges to vertices in the full function call
network extending between all directories (including <code>/inst</code>)
have progressively declined throughout the history of CRAN. Prior to
2005, most functions (or objects) were called or otherwise referenced at
least 4 times within a package, decreasing to just over 3 calls or
references in recent years. The final line in Fig. 8C, “n_clusters”,
reveals that functions (or objects) within packages cluster within on
average around three main groups.</p>
<p>The final panel (Fig. 8D) shows average centrality metrics from
function call networks, which is stable except for numbers of terminal
edges (in that context, meaning numbers of functions which call no other
functions), which decreased since around 2005 from over 13 per package
to under 10 in 2015, before more recently increasing once again.</p>

</h4>
<p>Analyses of sequential releases can only meaningfully be applied to
the function call networks of Figs. 8C-D, and so Fig. 9 depicts
equivalent values only for those two panels. Fig. 9A reveals that
function call networks tend to become more densely connected as packages
mature, and more so in <code>/src</code> than in <code>/R</code>
directories. The aggregate increase contrasts with the equivalent and
generally decreasing average tendency over time of Fig. 8C. This
contrast can again be explained by the fact that most packages only have
one or two releases, and so packages on CRAN have on average become less
internally connected over time as recently-released packages have
increasingly dominated. The decrease in package connectivity over one
year of Fig. 8C corresponds to an equivalent increase in Fig. 9A after
224 releases, indicating that decreases in internal connectivity through
increasing dominance of recently-released packages far outweighs
compensatory decreases through packages maturing.</p>

</div>
<p>Finally, centrality metrics change dramatically as packages mature
(Fig. 9B), in contrast to the annual changes of Fig. 8D. Packages
develop greater numbers of terminal edges, yet retain almost identical
vertex degrees through becoming more centralised as they develop. One
way such an effect could be achieved would be through transforming a
package from having several distinct clusters of functions, each
internally highly connected yet only loosely coupled to other clusters,
towards having fewer numbers of more highly centralised clusters.</p>

</h3>
<p>We conclude these results with analyses generated by the internal
Lines-of-Code routines of {pkgstats}, along with static analyses of the
function documentation (.Rd) files. Proportions of blank and comment
lines have remained similar in both <code>/R</code> and
<code>/src</code> directories over time, except for comment lines in
<code>/R</code> code, which have increased since around 2010. This
roughly corresponds to the first release of the {roxygen2}m package
which has done more than any other package to standardise documentation
of R functions. This increase in <code>/R</code> documentation is likely
a direct reflection of the widespread adoption of {roxygen2} as the
documentation standard for R packages.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/_fig10.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><strong>Figure 10.</strong> Code formatting and
documentation.</p>
</div>
<p>The relative proportion of white space in code lines has increased
consistently but slightly over time, amounting to an increase from
slightly under 13% to slightly over 14.5%. This value amounts to one
additional space for every 67 code characters. The most dramatic
development of Fig. 10B is clearly the decrease in the proportion of
files with tab-indentation, from well over 60% before the year 2000 to
barely over 10% today. Ignoring tabs, code indentation increased until
around 2005-2010, remaining constant at 3-3.5 spaces for many years
before more recently declining to well under 3 spaces.</p>
<p>Each R function in 1998 had an average of six parameters. This
declined rapidly to under four within two years (Fig. 10C). Numbers of
parameters have increased since then, and now exceed an average of four
parameters per function. Parameter documentation has followed an almost
identical trend, increasing from under 70 characters per parameter to
90-100. In contrast, total numbers of documentation lines per function
initially increased until around 2010, at almost 60 lines, before
decreasing more recently to 50 lines per function or less.</p>
<p>The equivalent results analysed as a function of release sequence
rather than year reveal that functions become better documented as
packages mature (Fig. 10D), although not through additional
documentation of parameters. As with preceding results, the recent
decrease in documentation lines per function likely reflects an
increasing prevalence of recently released packages which outweighs
increases in function documentation as individual packages mature.</p>
<p>Finally, contrasting Figs. 10C and 10D show likely show an increasing
dominance of recent packages on numbers of parameters per function.
While this number has increased over recent years (Fig. 10C), numbers of
parameters also decrease as packages mature, equating to an average of
one parameter fewer in all functions after 58 releases. The equivalent
annual effect (Fig. 10C) would translate to one additional parameter
every 46 years. The average interval between package releases over the
duration of CRAN has been 207 days, according to which 58 releases would
take 33 years. That comparison suggests that the effects of packages

<p>These results reveal a number of metrics which appear to have evolved
in one direction when collectively measured across all CRAN packages,
yet which tend to evolve in opposing directions within the evolution of
individual packages. An example is the metric of “coupling instability”
which has increased markedly for all packages since around 2010 (Fig.
6B), yet which decreases in any individual package from near one on
first release (due to new packages being unable to be used or depended
on by other packages) to near zero after around 100 releases. Additional
examples arose in proportions of calls to base R functions, which have
collectively decreased over time (Fig. 6A), from over 80 to under 70%,
while calls to contributed packages have collectively increased from
under 1% to almost 15% in 2022 While individual packages tend to use
proportionally fewer calls to base R functions as they mature, they also
use proportionally fewer calls to contributed packages, and substitute
both of these with increasing proportions of calls to recommended
packages (Fig. 7A). Simpler examples also arise in variables like
numbers of R functions per file, which have decreased consistently over
CRAN as a whole (Fig. 4D), yet which increase progressively as
individual packages mature (Fig. 5D).</p>
<p>These general patterns indicate the ubiquity of a dual dynamic
between individual packages tending to develop or evolve in one
particular direction, yet CRAN as a whole collectively developing in
opposing directions due to becoming increasingly dominated by less
mature packages in relatively preliminary states of development. It is
of course generally not straightforward for many metrics considered here
to determine whether an observed trajectory might be a positive
development for CRAN as a whole or not. The example of coupling
instability nevertheless provides one metric with a clear understanding,
and for which high values are generally considered undesirable <span class="citation">(Martin 2003)</span>. In this context at least, the
ongoing development of CRAN is defined by a dynamic balance between the
stabilising influence of mature packages, and the converse and
potentially destabilising influences of increasing numbers of recently
contributed packages.</p>
<p>Even balances between variables like these which are relatively easy
to interpret must be considered carefully. For example, the preceding
results made several comparisons through quantifying relative rates of
change of such opposing tendencies. Direct comparisons presume more
recent packages to have equal weight or influence on the overall system
dynamic as do more mature packages. It may be more appropriate to
implement some form of weighted analyses, for example, through weighting
the contributions of individual packages by numbers of dependent
packages. This point is considered further in the concluding section
below.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-influence-of-code-hosting-platforms">The Influence of Code-Hosting Platforms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-influence-of-code-hosting-platforms"></a>
</h4>
<p>Many results presented here manifest distinct temporal changes from
around the year 2010 onwards, or a year or two after the establishment
of online code-hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
<span class="citation">(Source Code Hosting 2022)</span>. The
synchronous advent of these platforms in Fig. 1B and increases in
acknowledged contributors since 2010 in Fig. 1A provides suggestive
evidence that the ability to collaboratively develop and disseminate
code on these platforms has led to an increase in public acknowledgement
of source code contributions. Encouragingly, these increases since
around 2012 are roughly linear, and show no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>GitHub has been the dominant platform by far, generally accounting
for close to an order of magnitude more URL entries than equivalent
git-based platforms such as Bitbucket and GitLab. The recent decrease of
GitHub URLs in the top ten shown in Fig. 2B has been slightly offset by
an increase in rOpenSci URLs. rOpenSci provides a peer-review service
for R packages, both generally improving code quality and publicising
packages to a wider audience than what they might otherwise have reached
from authors’ own GitHub profile pages. These increases in both GitHub
and rOpenSci URLs reflect increased community engagement in the ongoing
development of R packages.</p>
<p>While such increased engagement may generally be viewed as positive,
increased public awareness of other peoples code facilitated by code
hosting platforms also seems to have produced increased dependence of R
packages on other R packages. Coupling instability between packages has
increased markedly since 2010 (Fig. 6B). (The less clear patterns of
Gini coefficients of equality of dependency networks are discussed
further below.)</p>
<p>Several of the network metrics of Fig. 8 also generally reveal abrupt
transitions around 2012. The proportion of packages not imported by any
others increased very abruptly (Fig. 8A), although this seems to have
stabilised more recently, at around 60-70% of all packages. The increase
in vertex degree also shown in that panel has nevertheless increased
more progressively, only increasing at a slower rate more recently. As
mentioned, these increases must mean that each package which is imported
by other packages is imported an increasing number of times.</p>
<p>The additional network metrics of Fig. 8B (network centrality, and
mean inter-nodal distance) all manifest generally progressive linear
trajectories up until around 2013, following which they have largely
stabilised. This initial phase prior to that time was marked by
decreasing centrality alongside increasing inter-nodal distances,
suggestive of a de-centralising network. Against this trajectory, the
advent of code hosting platforms has clearly had a stabilising effect in
once again “re-centralising” the CRAN dependency network, and decreasing
inter-nodal distances.</p>

<h3 id="quantifying-the-temporal-development-of-software-systems">Quantifying the temporal development of software systems<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quantifying-the-temporal-development-of-software-systems"></a>
</h3>
<p>We calculated two measures of temporal development of software on
CRAN. “Snapshot” values considered the collective properties of the
system as it existed in each year, including latest versions of all
packages regardless of when those packages were last updated. “Annual”
values only considered software uploaded in each year. Snapshot values
may be generally presumed to reflect exponentially-smoothed versions of
annual values, so these two approaches to aggregating annual values
ought to qualitatively agree. Nonetheless, some distinct differences
appear when comparing these two approaches.</p>
<p>Such differences appear in the annual change of Gini coefficients of
Fig. 6C, which presented coefficients both for inequality between
numbers of package dependencies, and numbers of individual functions
from those dependencies. Calculating annual values only from software
uploaded in each year (“annual” values; solid lines in that figure)
yielded Gini coefficients which have decreased over the last two
decades, while using “snapshot” values produced opposing trajectories of
increasing Gini coefficients (dashed lines).</p>
<p><span class="citation">Decan, Mens, and Grosjean (2019)</span>
claimed that Gini coefficients for all seven package distribution
systems they studied had increased over time. These coefficients measure
relative inequality in the distributions of numbers of package imports,
with larger values reflecting systems with greater disparities between
packages in numbers of imports. While <span class="citation">Decan,
Mens, and Grosjean (2019)</span> did not explicitly describe how they
defined their annual figures, all data were derived from the
“meta-platform” <code>libraries.io</code>, which collates software from
several distribution systems and computer languages. Use of data from
this platform would only enable “annual” rather than “snapshot” values
to be calculated.</p>
<p>For discrete, non-negative variables such as counts, Gini
coefficients must generally increase with the scale or maximal values of
those variables. Thus if average numbers of imported packages (or
functions) increases over time, so should Gini coefficients. This
suggests that observations of increasing Gini coefficients should be
interpreted cautiously, as they may merely reflect uniformly increasing
dependence on external packages, while observations of decreasing Gini
coefficients, as with our “snapshot” values, may reflect genuine
changes. Whatever the underlying cause of these observed differences,
they clearly reveal the critical importance of precisely specifying the
methods used to aggregate annual values. Whatever the underlying cause
of these observed differences, they clearly reveal the critical
importance of precisely specifying the methods used to aggregate annual

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="collective-versus-individual-software-evolution">Collective versus individual software evolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collective-versus-individual-software-evolution"></a>
</h4>
<p>Beyond methods used to aggregate annual values, these results reveal
striking contrasts between the collective evolution of CRAN as a unified
software ecosystem, and the development trajectories of individual
packages. Consider, for example, Fig. 3 showing numbers of files. These
manifest clearly increasing trajectories over the lifetimes of
individual packages, yet trajectories for CRAN as a whole are far less
clear, mixing increases with decreases with other, non-linear patterns.
This only clear insight that emerges from the two panels of this figure
is that this metric provides direct insight into the evolution of
individual packages. Given the foregoing discussions of increasing
dominance over time of newer and relatively less mature packages on
CRAN, the annual developments of Fig. 3A may indeed reflect nothing more
than a confounding of individually-increasing numbers of files in more
mature packages mixed with increasing numeric dominance of less mature
packages in the system as a whole. Other results such as Fig. 4D
(decreasing numbers of functions per file per year) and 5D (increasing
numbers of functions per file per release) clearly reflect opposing
trajectories, against which any intermediate results such as initially
increasing annual numbers of functions followed by subsequent decreases
(Fig. 4C) must be presumed to reflect a dynamic balance between the
trajectories of individual packages (clear increases in Fig. 5C) with
increasing dominance of newer packages.</p>
<p>These and many other aspects of these results clearly indicate that
the temporal evolution of collective software systems can only be
understood alongside equivalent understanding of the temporal evolution
of individual packages. Collective properties alone are inadequate to
understand how a software system has actually evolved. Moreover, future
work will likely have to consider and contrast schemes for weighting the
relative contributions of different packages to the software ecosystem
as a whole. The present results applied uniform weights to all packages,
regardless of whether an individual package has 100 lines of code and
has never been updated or even downloaded, or whether it has thousands
of lines of code and orders of magnitude more downloads. Deriving and
applying weighting schemes will be an extremely difficult endeavour,
especially because there can never be any single, optimal scheme for
doing so, and reported results will be intimately dependent on any
chosen weighting scheme. We hope that the present work provides a firm
empirical basis from which to begin the task of developing such schemes
in order to further understanding of the evolution of software
ecosystems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to return to where we started, with the initial
consideration of “packages to compute on R packages” <span class="citation">(Hornik 2012)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we need better data to do computational statistics on statistical
computing solutions: certainly, the CRAN package repository should be an
extremely valuable resource for the community, both for gathering and
analyzing such data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This study has demonstrated that the comparably unique nature of
CRAN, in being both centralised and archived, does indeed ensure that it
represents an extremely valuable resource. We hope that this present
study represents an intermediate milestone on the journey first hinted
at one decade ago of attempts to delve deeper in to the wealth of data
provided by CRAN.</p>
