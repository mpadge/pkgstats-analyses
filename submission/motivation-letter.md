Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article entitled, "Historical Trends in R Package Structure
and Interdependency on CRAN", for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript is primarily a research article, providing an overview of the
statistical development of the entire CRAN archive of over 140,000 package
versions. The analyses are performed with a newly developed package called
`pkgstats`, which provides detailed static analyses of the entire contents of R
packages. This package represents current "state-of-the-art" code analyses of
the kind first called for in a 2012 article by Kurt Horkik, which highlighted a
need for 'computing on R packages.' In effect, this submission represents the
first comprehensive attempt to meet that longstanding need.
